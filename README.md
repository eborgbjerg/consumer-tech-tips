# Don't throw out your laptop just yet!

As MS Windows 10 is no longer supported, its users are being pressured into upgrading.
But in many cases, it may be that your computer (laptop or desktop) is not suited for running Windows 11.
For example, the computer might not have sufficient RAM memory.

What many people don't know is that it is relatively easy to install a Linux-based system, which in many cases will run absolutely fine.
Check out the Lubuntu Linux system - see the link.

Whereas Windows 11 will hardly run in any meaningful way on e.g. a laptop with 4GB RAM, the Lubuntu desktop typically will run great.
