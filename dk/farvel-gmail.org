#+TITLE: Farvel til GMail



På https://european-alternatives.eu/ findes et katalog over europæiske alternativer indenfor digitale produkter og tjenester.
Her findes i skrivende stund 21 alternativer i kategorien 'Email Providers' (email udbydere).

I det følgende beskriver jeg, hvordan man i praksis kan flytte sin email fra GMail til en af de europæiske udbydere.

Af de 21 på listen har jeg foreløbig afprøvet Posteo og Proton, som begge ser fornuftige ud.
Der var ikke nogen speciel grund til at det lige var de to jeg prøvede, det var blot dem jeg først hørte om.

Posteo har en prøveperiode på 14 dage, hvor man får pengene tilbage hvis man ikke ønsker at fortsætte derefter.
Proton har et gratis abonnement med 500MB plads.

* Før flytningen

Det er en god ide at forberede sig lidt før man giver sig i kast med at flytte sine emails fra
sin eksisterende postkasse hos GMail til sin nye postkasse. Det er primært et spørgsmål om plads.
Man bør i almindelighed overveje følgende

- Hvor meget plads bruger ens nuværende postkasse i GMail?

- Er der nogle emails i GMail som fylder meget - måske endda mere end den nye udbyder tillader?

Hvis nogle af dine emails hos GMail fylder mere end den nye udbyder accepterer, så vil det være en god ide at
gamme indholdet af disse emails på din egen computer inden du eksporterer fra GMail.

GMail tillader emails der fylder op til 50MB inklusive vedhæftinger.
Posteo har samme øvre grænse, mens Proton har en grænse på 25MB.

For at finde emails i GMail der fylder mere end fx. 25MB, gå ind i GMail i en browser, og
indtast følgende i søgefeltet øverst:

~size:25M~

[[file:./gmail-search-by-size.png]]

Sørg for at få gemt indhold og vedhæftede filer fra de emails, hvis størrelse overstiger maksimumsstørrelsen hos den nye
udbyder, inden du eksporterer postkassen.

overvej at lave en sikkerhedskopi (MBOX)

Q: No, my question is: How to import an MBOX file in Thunderbird.
The version I have from Ubuntu "snap store" seems to be limited somehow!?

A: The ImportExportTools NG add-on is indeed a tool that can be used to import MBOX files into Thunderbird. Here are the corrected steps to import an MBOX file into Thunderbird:

1. **Install Thunderbird**:
   - Ensure you have Mozilla Thunderbird installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Thunderbird website](https://www.thunderbird.net/).

2. **Install the ImportExportTools NG Add-on**:
   - Open Thunderbird.
   - Go to the `Tools` menu and select `Add-ons`.
   - Search for `ImportExportTools NG` and click `Add to Thunderbird`.
   - Restart Thunderbird to complete the installation.

3. **Import the MBOX File**:
   - Once the add-on is installed, go to the `Tools` menu again.
   - Select `ImportExportTools NG` and then `Import mbox file`.
   - Navigate to the location of your MBOX file and select it.
   - Choose the folder in Thunderbird where you want to import the emails.
   - Click `OK` to start the import process.

4. **Monitor the Import Process**:
   - Thunderbird will begin importing the emails from the MBOX file into the selected folder.
   - You can monitor the progress in the Thunderbird interface.

By following these steps, you should be able to import an MBOX file into Thunderbird successfully.
If you encounter any issues, please ensure that the ImportExportTools NG add-on is properly installed
and that you have the correct version of Thunderbird.


even after instaling the ImportExport NG addon to Thunderbird,
the Tools menu does not contain any item for that. Same Import item as before, it won't alllow for importing MBOX files.

If the ImportExportTools NG addon is not showing up in the Tools menu of Thunderbird, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check Add-on Installation**: Ensure that the add-on is properly installed and enabled. You can do this by going to `Tools` > `Add-ons and Themes` and verifying that ImportExportTools NG is listed and activated.

2. **Restart Thunderbird**: Sometimes, a simple restart of Thunderbird can resolve issues with add-ons not appearing correctly.

3. **Menu Bar Visibility**: Make sure the menu bar is visible. Depending on your version of Thunderbird, you might need to enable the menu bar under the `View` or `Customize` options .

4. **Compatibility Issues**: Ensure that the version of ImportExportTools NG you have installed is compatible with your version of Thunderbird. Compatibility issues can sometimes cause the add-on to not function correctly .

5. **Alternative Access**: If the add-on is installed but not appearing in the Tools menu, you can try accessing its features by right-clicking on a folder or message and looking for the ImportExportTools NG options in the context menu .

6. **Reinstall the Add-on**: If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and then reinstalling the add-on. You can download the latest version from the [Thunderbird Add-ons website](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/) .

7. **Check for Errors**: Look for any error messages or notifications that might indicate why the add-on is not functioning as expected.

If you continue to experience issues, you might want to check the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/thunderbird/import-export-tools-ng/issues) for the add-on to see if others are experiencing similar problems or to report your issue .

In GMail, using Google Takeout, I export my mailbox in the MBOX format.
Can this MBOX file be imported into a mail account in Posteo?

Yes, you can import an MBOX file into a Posteo mail account, but it requires some specific steps. Posteo does not directly support the import of MBOX files, so you will need to use an email client that supports MBOX files and then transfer the emails to Posteo. Here’s a general approach you can follow:

1. **Use an Email Client**: Use an email client like Mozilla Thunderbird that supports MBOX files. Import the MBOX file into Thunderbird.

2. **Configure Posteo Account**: Set up your Posteo account in Thunderbird using IMAP settings. This will allow you to access your Posteo emails within Thunderbird.

3. **Transfer Emails**: Once your Posteo account is set up in Thunderbird, you can drag and drop the imported emails from the local folders (where the MBOX file was imported) to your Posteo account folders.

4. **Sync with Posteo**: After transferring the emails, Thunderbird will sync them with your Posteo account, making them accessible in your Posteo webmail interface.

By following these steps, you can effectively transfer emails from an MBOX file to your Posteo account.
