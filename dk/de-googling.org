A: ?

Q: How much would Corning receive for 1 device with the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+

A: The Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is manufactured using a 4-nanometer process technology, which is designed
to enhance its durability and scratch resistance. The glass is specifically engineered to withstand drops
onto rough surfaces like concrete from heights of up to one meter,
which is a significant improvement over previous generations that typically fail at half that height .

The price for the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is not publicly disclosed, as it is typically sold
to manufacturers like Samsung for use in their devices rather than directly to consumers.
However, the benefits it provides in terms of durability and scratch resistance contribute
to the overall value and pricing of the devices that incorporate it.

Based on the information available, the cost of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for a manufacturer like Samsung
is likely to be in the range of $20 to $30 per device.
This estimate is derived from the typical pricing for high-end protective glass used in smartphones,
considering the advanced features and durability improvements offered by Gorilla Glass Victus 2.

** Farvel til GMail

På https://european-alternatives.eu/ findes et katalog over europæiske alternativer indenfor digitale produkter og tjenester.
Her findes i skrivende stund 21 alternativer i kategorien Email Providers.

I det følgende beskriver jeg hvordan man i praksis kan flytte sin email fra GMail til en af de europæiske udbydere.

Af de 21 på listen har jeg foreløbig afprøvet Posteo og Proton, som begge ser fornuftige ud.
Posteo har en prøveperiode på 14 dage, hvor man får pengene tilbage hvis man ikke ønsker at fortsætte derefter.
Proton har et gratis abonnement med 500MB plads.



*** Før migreringen

Strengt taget behøver man ikke at nedlægge sin GMail konto, man kan i stedet vælge at videresende.

Q:

If I deactivate Google Maps on my Android phone, and instead use HERE WeGo for navigation,
will Google still pick up any data or money when I use HERE WeGo ?

A:

If you deactivate Google Maps and switch to using HERE WeGo for navigation, Google will generally not collect data directly from your use of HERE WeGo. However, there are a few considerations:

1. **Data Collection by HERE WeGo**: HERE WeGo collects location data and other information to provide navigation services, but it emphasizes that no personal user data is collected without explicit user consent. The data collected is anonymized and cannot be tracked back to individuals .

2. **Google's Data Collection**: Google may still collect data from your Android device through other means, such as Google Play Services, which are integral to the Android operating system. This data can include app usage statistics, location data (if location services are enabled), and other diagnostic information.

3. **Advertising and Revenue**: Google benefits financially from data collection and advertising. Even if you're not using Google Maps, Google can still serve ads based on your overall app usage and location data collected through other Google services on your device .

4. **Privacy Settings**: To minimize data collection by Google, you can adjust your privacy settings on your Android device. This includes turning off location services, limiting app permissions, and opting out of personalized ads.

By using HERE WeGo, you can reduce the amount of location data shared with Google, but it's important to manage your device's privacy settings to control data collection more broadly.
